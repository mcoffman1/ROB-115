# ROB-115 â€“ Intro to ROS: Student Reference Repository

> **Note:** This repository is a collection of **beginner-level scripts** created for students in the ROB-115 course: *Introduction to ROS (Robot Operating System)*. All files are custom made and intended as **learning tools**, not full project solutions.

## ðŸ“š About This Repository

This repository includes example code and reference materials to help you get started with programming and working in a ROS environment. The files are intentionally simple and focus on the **fundamentals** â€” things like:

- ROS **publishers and subscribers**
- Basic control loops
- Simple logic and data handling
- ROS launch files to run nodes

These scripts are designed to help you understand how ROS works and how to build your own nodes from scratch.

## ðŸ§  How to Use This Repository

- Treat these files as **reference examples** â€” study them, run them, and try modifying them.
- **Don't copy** code into your assignments without understanding what it does.
- Youâ€™re encouraged to:
  - Use the examples as starting points
  - Experiment by changing things and seeing what happens
  - Break things and learn how to fix them
  - Ask questions if you're stuck


## ðŸ’¡ Topics Covered

- ROS node creation (C++ & Python)
- Publishers and subscribers
- ROS messages
- Basic loops, conditionals, and functions
- Simple Arduino integration
- Launch file usage

## ðŸš§ Ongoing Updates

This repository may be updated during the course. Be sure to check for updates or pull the latest version if instructed.
